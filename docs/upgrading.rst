Upgrading
=========

.. note:: Mac users may need to use "sudo", but try it without the "sudo"
   first. (Or was that "sussudio"? "Su-su-sussudiooo!!" But use `virtualenv`_
   if you don't want to sudo.)

.. _`virtualenv`: http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/

How to Upgrade From an Earlier Version
--------------------------------------

To upgrade Complexity::

    $ pip install -U complexity

Things to Know Before Upgrading
-------------------------------

Some releases may require you to make changes on your end; if so, instructions
will be described in :doc:`history`.

Of course, if you run into any problems and need help, file an issue with
details so someone can help.
