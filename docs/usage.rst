Setup
-----

Create this directory structure for your site::

    my_project/
        input/
        output/

In `input/`, create your templates.

Put static files into the `css/`, `js/`, and `img/` directories of `output/`. (Creating additional directories like `ico/` is fine.)

To Generate HTML and Serve It Locally
-------------------------------------

Run the `complexity` command::

    $ complexity

Open a web browser to http://127.0.0.1:9090. You should see your newly generated site!

To Upload Your Site to Amazon S3
