Complexity Sphinx Style
========================

This directory contains the Complexity Sphinx theme and styles. 

It is a derivative of the Sphinx styles that Kenneth Reitz uses in most of his
projects, which is a derivative of Armin Ronacher's themes for Flask and Flask
related projects. 

Out of respect to both Armin Ronacher and Kenneth Reitz, this theme has been
heavily customized so as to present a very different look and feel.

This theme may be used by Complexity-related projects without modification. 

If you use it for a project unrelated to Complexity, customize it heavily so
that it looks substantially different.
